#ASLapp
## **What is this?**

This is a phone application that helps the user learn ASL (American Sign Language).

## **Features of the project**
- A mode that cycles through images of ASL letters spelling a word. The user must input the word shown to them after all images have been cycled through. The speed in which the images change can be set by the user using a slider.
- Flash card like mode where a common ASL word/gesture is shown to the user and the user must type in the correct meaning of it.
- Links to video tutorials on learning ASL
- A "dictionary" of letters, words, and gestures used in the program so the user may study before trying the tests/flash cards.
- A mode that shows a word/phrase and the user must select the correct image of ASL that translates to the shown word/phrase. (I.E if the show phrase was "Thank you" the user would have to correctly select the gesture for "thank you" )

All of these features can be accessed from the main menu.

All features can be used on landscape mode but work better on portrait mode.
